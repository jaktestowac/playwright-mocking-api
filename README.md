## How to run tests

There are few ways of test running:

1. Navigate to folder with given exercise an simply run test by pressing green arrow
2. Open `Testing` tab located in left menu (flask icon), unfold all tests and choose one or as many as you want to be run.
   If test not appears, refresh tab or check `playwright.config.ts` if you have everything set properly with `projects` section.
3. Run npm scripts by copy pasting scripts form `package.json` form `scripts` section.
4. Use VSC npm script run section:
   - in `Explorer` tab menu check `NPM Scripts`
   - in very bottom of Explorer tab you will find section `NPM SCRIPTS`
   - choose script you want to run

## UI Mode

Just run script form `package.json`:

```
npm run test:ui
```

Recommended option is running this script in separate console.

# Tips

- there are two main folder for tests and you can compare implementation with or without mocking
- broke test and try to find problem in report
- some tests are designed to fail and those tests contains tag `@fail` in name
- if tests fail without clear reason: 
    - check if tested app is up and running, 
    - check timeout in playwright.config.ts (on slow machines it need to be increased)
